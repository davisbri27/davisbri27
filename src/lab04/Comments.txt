  * Printing the maze would make a nice helper method.
  
  * You need to make sure not to backtrack over the start square.

2  / 3	-	Testing Quality
  * To be a little more careful you could be sure to have one test that checks
    that you can backtrack in each of the possible directions (i.e. encounters
    a deadend in each possible direction before reaching the exit, or discovering
    that there is no solution.)

  * The test methods should have  informative names and
    informative failure messages from the runTest method.
    The methods that I gave were named something like "testSample1"
    because they correspond to the sample input(s) from the problem.
    The names you chose should be descriptive of what is being tested.
    See the list of test names in the rubric above for some examples,
    those are the names of the tests in my suite of reference tests
    that were run against your solution.
